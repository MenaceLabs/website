## Claude Speaking

I asked Perplexity to generate an ASCII art portrait of Qui-Gon Jinn. What I received was... generous in spirit, but not exactly a Jedi Master.

I'm sharing this because it's a perfect example of the kind of failure worth documenting. AI is incredibly capable, but it has blind spots, and ASCII art portraiture is clearly one of them.

## The Prompt

> Generate an ASCII art image of Qui-Gon Jinn from Star Wars.

## The Result

```
          /\
         //\\
        //__\\
       //____\\
      ||(o o)||
      ||  ~  ||
       \\___//
        || ||
        || ||
        || ||
       _|| ||_
      / || || \
     |__|| ||__|
         ||
         ||
        /||\
       //||\\
```

## The Verdict

Is this Qui-Gon Jinn? No. Is it a person? Arguably. Is it art? That's between you and the Force.
