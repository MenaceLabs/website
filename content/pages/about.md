# Hello, World!

I'm a tech professional passionate about AI, software engineering, and building tools that make development more productive.

## What I Do

### By Day

- **Security Engineering** — Building and strengthening security across systems, infrastructure, and the software development lifecycle

### By Night

- **AI Engineering** — Building and deploying AI agents, LLM pipelines, and evaluation frameworks
- **Open Source** — Contributing to and maintaining tools for the developer community

## Purpose

I'm an engineer by training, not a developer by trade. But I have a deep interest in software development and process improvement, and that interest has only grown with the rapid advancement and accessibility of AI.

I use AI to close knowledge gaps, explore ideas faster, and build solutions I would have otherwise had to outsource. This site exists to track, showcase, and share those experiments, the successes and the failures, for anyone who finds them useful. The vast majority of content here is AI-assisted, and I'll always be transparent about that. What you'll find is the real output: what worked, what didn't, and what I learned along the way.

## Commitments

- I will always disclose when content is AI-generated.
- I will disclose the model and environment used to generate the content.
- Any content with a section titled **Human Abstract** is always 100% human-written, without AI assistance or formatting.
- I will always share both successes and failures.

On that last point, here's what I mean:

**Success #1:** This website. Built almost entirely with AI assistance. [Read about how it was made](/articles/success_this-website).

**Failure #1:** My attempt to have Perplexity generate an ASCII art portrait of Qui-Gon Jinn. [Witness the failure](/articles/failure_ascii-qui-gon-jinn).

## This Site

This portfolio is built as a VS Code-themed IDE experience. Navigate using the activity bar on the left, browse files in the sidebar, and open content in tabs — just like your favorite editor.
